# fastai_core
Experiment to make a fastai core with a  cross platform design: python, swift

This repositiry is an offspring from fastai 2019 part 2 "Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders".

The purpose here is to refactor the lessons learned to  :

- a design that is as crossplatform as possible : python and swift
- use of established designpatterns as much as possible
